# BuzzButton: an induction energy generator inspired by the mechanics of the simple button spinner
This project served as a senior thesis, independent study, and senior capstone project for three Brown University undergraduates, and resulted in a (utility) patent-pending device. The novel part was mounting the button spinner toy (https://youtu.be/-QMmfDhrZxg) to a stationary component (https://youtu.be/ks05l4el3eo) via a low friction ball bearing, which enables better control of the spinning disc and the development of an axial induction energy generator (https://drive.google.com/file/d/16kPrUAi85ClkKdtuXTI8HTNAFw5Z9hoD/view?usp=sharing). 
This repository includes data analysis tools for interpreting images from a 1000 FPS camera (Casio Exilim EX-FH20 9.1 MP Digital Camera) of the button spinner in action to calculate angular velocity through time and the string length, which are necessary inputs  for validating the Mathematica model developed in Haneesh Kesari's Applied Mechanics Lab at Brown.
