# BuzzButton: an induction energy generator inspired by the mechanics of the simple button spinner
This project served as a senior thesis, independent study, and senior capstone project, and resulted in a (utility) patent-pending high speed, axial induction energy generator. The prototype continuously generates 5 watts of electricity and weighs under 1 lb. I mounted a "button-on-a-string" children's toy (https://youtu.be/-QMmfDhrZxg) to a stationary component (https://youtu.be/ks05l4el3eo) via a low friction ball bearing, allowing control of the spinning disc and the development of a high voltage axial induction energy generator (https://drive.google.com/file/d/16kPrUAi85ClkKdtuXTI8HTNAFw5Z9hoD/view?usp=sharing). 

This repository includes data analysis tools for interpreting images from a 1000 FPS camera (Casio Exilim EX-FH20 9.1 MP Digital Camera) of the button spinner in action to calculate angular velocity through time and the string length, which are necessary inputs  for validating the Mathematica model developed in Haneesh Kesari's Applied Mechanics Lab at Brown.
